This will eventually be a web application for parents to manage their family's
chores.

It should allow parents to create chores, collect those chores in a list
associated with a particular date, and task family members to complete those
lists.

## Things to do

* Red-Green-Refactor a whole lot acceptance (request) specs
* Add Twitter's Bootstrap project
* Customize Devise views to work with Bootstrap
* Install and customize CanCan for Parent/Child roles and permissions
